Stewart Butterfield said last month on The Vergecast that companies do not invest in effective communication and than they want their employees to communicate constantly and expect them to do it effectively.

This reminded me of some mistakes I used to make (and still make) when communicating and also when Carmen Larsen comes to my desk after I send an email or say something in a meeting and explains me why what I said could be confusing/misleading for the customer and how I could have expressed my point in a better way. Not a course per se, but valuable feedback I keep in mind for the future.

I try to remind myself that not every person has the same knowledge in the topic you are talking about, they may have other areas of expertise or know much more than you think. Also, they are definitely not sharing my context, so I try to state everything I mean and not assume that they may get it by the other ideas I said or have in mind or the tone I am using.
