[See original post in my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alvaro-albero-gran-416554128_the-basecamp-guide-to-internal-communication-activity-6635880388982112256-jtPw)

A very interesting guide on internal communication from Basecamp, a remote first company where communication is key.

During my job experience and team projects at school, there has always been some miscommunication creating confusion and unreal expectations.

There are a few points in this guide that would have definitely helped:
- Long permanent forms instead of quick chats and meetings
- Use a centralized application
- Keep the discussion attach to the item being discussed
- Communication is always an interruption, choose the right timing and words
- Post a daily summary in the general channel
- Post a weekly view on what you will be working that week in the general channel
- Once in a while, talk about personal stuff such as hobbies or activities
- Now and ASAP are overrated and a toxic behavior

I will keep them in mind for my next collaborations!
