My friend Vanesa Olivares Velencoso has sent us today a pdf file with more than 400 books from the Springer publishing company that are available for download for free (it may not be forever!)

Juan Compadre suggested if someone wanted to do a script to download them all, I liked the idea and went ahead.

In the following GitHub repo you have the script and files to download as many books as you like from pdf list (Springer_All_Ebooks.pdf). I also include the steps that you need to follow to make the download.

Feel free to make any suggestions on the code, I like feedback :)

I hope this is useful!
