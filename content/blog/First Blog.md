As my graduation was approaching, I started preparing my resume, sharpening some technical and interview skills and getting ready for my job search journey. 
I have previous experience as a Software Engineer and I feel confident about my knowledge, I am always looking to learn more, but I believe I have a solid foundation.
However, in the past months I have struggle to land some interviews. I think I've done a good job in the ones I got, both in the phone screen and technical interview, but someone did better and I did not get the position.

Analyzing what could be a solution to the job search problem, I thought that the focus should not be in increasing my interview abilities, if I assume that I have a 20% chance of getting a job once I get to the interview point, assuming they do not need a US citizen or permanent resident (I really think job search websites should have a check for this), increasing this to a 25-30% does not make a big difference. What I believe makes a difference is getting 50 interviews instead of 10, so that is my goal by creating this portfolio website. I think I usually do a good job on explaining who I am, what I know and where I would like to work, but after reading some job search journeys and some people on Twitter I thought that having a portfolio website should definitely help.

I give all the credit for the Hugo template to [Sam Robins](https://github.com/samrobbins85/hugo-developer-portfolio). I do not see this website as a personal project, it's just a medium to show my work and write some posts :)

I hope you can learn more about me here.

Best,
Alvaro.
