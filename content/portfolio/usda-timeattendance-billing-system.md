## Description
This was the main project I worked at during my experience at AQUAS Inc. It was a great opportunity because it was the first time, I participated in such a large codebase. The application has more than 100 pages, 200 tables and 200 stored procedures. To be honest, this is totally overwhelming the first time you look at it, just trying to understand how part of the application was linked and working took me a while.

Step by step, after reading thousands and thousands of lines of code, I started feeling confident on my understanding of the system and made my first changes. I was learning fast and my role in the team completely changed from the new guy to a reliable developer that can be trusted and given tough tasks.

I had a full stack role in this project, some of my tasks were:
- Participate in meetings with the product owner to understand their needs
- Collaborate with the Project Manager and other team members to review user stories 
- Develop new views for the website
- Write business logic for Time & Attendance, Expenses, Billing and other sections of the application
- Update hundreds of Stored Procedures 
- Refactor some STP with thousands of lines to improve readability and maintainability (this helped fixing so many bugs we were having with time and billing rules)
- Update reports using SQL Server Reporting Services
- Fix bugs reported after User Testing
- Deploy to IIS in Development and Test environments

I worked on this project for about 14 months, two of those remotely with a 6h time difference. It was the first time I was working fully remote but it was a great experience, I was able to adapt and kept being productive.
