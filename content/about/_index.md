Hi! I’m Alvaro, a Software Engineer looking for a new opportunity in the industry. I am an analytical person that loves writing software, solving problems and learning new things. I am looking for a full-time position, I am willing to relocate across US but I can also work remotely. I would love to work for a company where collaboration is encouraged, I can take ownership of the code I write, and learn from senior engineers and managers. I can bring to the table problem solving skills, software development with quality code, team work and a great motivation to learn and improve.

Other interests I have besides software engineering are fitness and health, meeting up with friends and family (I'm very social), and learning about general topics such as economy, politics, sociology and psychology. I really like understanding how things work so learning is a constant!

After finishing my Bachelor’s degree, I decided to start working as a Software Engineer. My experience in AQUAS was great, I had written software applications before, but working in a multidisciplinary professional team, following a SCRUM methodology, having deadlines that needed to be met was something different, and I really enjoyed it. I also gained a lot of technical knowledge thanks to my hard work and my coworkers.

I then decided to enroll in a MS in Computer Science at GWU. I felt going back to school would be great to keep developing my technical skills, learning from great professors as well as meeting students with the same interests as me. I focused on taking classes that involved programming, as I was sure I wanted to be a Software Engineer and not go into research. I also had the opportunity to work with Dr. Gabriel Parmer during Summer 2020 and enhanced the auto grading software for his Operating Systems class.

Now that I have finished the MS, I want to go back to the software industry. Contact me if you want to know more about my story, work experience or personal projects.

Best!
Alvaro.
