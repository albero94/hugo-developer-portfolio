Hi! I'm Alvaro, a Software Engineer looking for a new opportunity in the industry. 
I am an analytical person that loves writing software, solving problems and learning new things, both technical and general.
I am looking for a full time position, I am willing to relocate across US but I can also work remotely.
I would love to work for a company where collaboration is encouraged, I can take ownership of the code I write, and learn from senior engineers.
I can bring to the table problem solving skills, team work and a great motivation to learn and improve.

Other interests I have besides software are fintess and health, socializing with friends and family, and learning about general topics such as economy, politics, sociology and psicology. I really like understanding how things work.

After finishing my Bachelor's degree, I decided to start working as a Software Engineer.
My experience in AQUAS was great, I had developed applications before, but working in a multidisciplinary professional team,
following a SCRUM methodology, having deadlines that needed to be met was something different, and I really enjoyed it.
I also gained a lot of technical knowledge thanks to my hard work and senior engineers.

I then decided to enroll in a MS in Computer Science at GWU. I really enjoy learning new things, and I felt going back to school
would be great to keep developing my technical skills, collaborate with professors as well as met students with the same interests as me.
I focused on taking classes that involved programming, as I was sure I wanted to be a Software Engineer and not go into research.
I also had the opportunity to work with Dr. Gabriel Parmer during Summer 2020 and enhanced the autograding software for his Operating Systems class.

Now that I have finished the MS, I want to go back to the software industry.
Contact me if you wan to know more about my story, work experience or personal projects.
